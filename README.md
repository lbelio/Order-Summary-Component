## Overview

As a recent learner of HTML and CSS through an Udemy.com web development course, I wanted to solidify my understanding of these foundational technologies before diving into JavaScript. This small project, inspired by the Order Summary Card challenge, provided the perfect opportunity for me to put my skills to the test. I made a deliberate choice to work with vanilla CSS instead of relying on frameworks like Bootstrap or SASS, as I aimed to gain a deeper understanding of essential CSS elements, particularly flexbox.

## My process

This project marked a significant milestone for me as it was the first time I independently worked on a CSS and HTML project without following along with someone else's code. Although I initially felt confident, I soon realized the gaps in my knowledge. Aligning the elements proved to be the most challenging aspect. To overcome this, I dedicated time to thoroughly explore the layout options, studying relevant documentation on the Mozilla Developer website and experimenting with various techniques. Eventually, I settled on utilizing flexbox, which proved to be the right choice.

I began by carefully examining all the design images provided and translated them into HTML structure. Next, I implemented the CSS properties that applied globally, such as background color and font family. I then divided the HTML into logical segments based on the design images, making it easier to style each component. Once I successfully positioned the main card component in the center of the screen, I proceeded to style the remaining elements from top to bottom.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Through this project, I gained valuable experience and knowledge, including:

Strengthening my confidence in using CSS flexbox for layout
Realizing the importance of referring to available resources, such as my Udemy.com course and the Mozilla Developer documentation, to advance my learning journey

### Continued development

To further enhance my skills and solidify my understanding of CSS flexbox, I plan to undertake similar projects in the future. Additionally, I aim to improve my muscle memory when it comes to typing basic HTML and CSS syntax. Furthermore, I intend to focus on enhancing the accessibility and responsiveness of my webpages, with a particular focus on practicing the creation of media queries.
